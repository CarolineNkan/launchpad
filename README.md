🚀 LaunchPad

Find real entry-level roles faster (0–2 years only).

🌍 Problem

Graduates and students face a paradox: “entry-level” jobs often require 3–5 years of experience. This barrier creates stress, wasted time, and missed opportunities.

💡 Solution

LaunchPad is a lightweight web app that filters jobs to show only true entry-level roles (0–2 years).

Search any job title.

Use quick chips for popular roles.

Get clean, scannable results with Apply links.

Focus your energy on jobs you can actually land.

✨ Features

🔎 Search bar: instantly find roles by keyword.

🎯 Smart filter: only jobs requiring 0–2 years show up.

⚡ Quick chips: 1-click demo (e.g., Junior Developer, Data Analyst).

📋 Clean UI: professional cards with badges + Apply button.

🌐 Direct links: jump straight to LinkedIn/Indeed postings.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python + Streamlit → fast, intuitive UI (perfect for hackathons).

CSV dataset → mock + real job postings for demo.

Custom CSS → polished, professional design (hero band, white cards, badges).

Why Streamlit?
We chose Streamlit for speed and clarity. Alternatives like Flask/Django require heavy setup and boilerplate. Streamlit let us focus on impact + UX, not wiring, which matches hackathon judging priorities.
